## Phonegap-Events-test ##
A record of Test for Phonegap Events

NOTE: While the volume button is not available for Android and iOS, the volume can be controlled via the Phonegap core [Media plugin](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.3.0/cordova_media_media.md.html#Media). 3rd-party plugins are available for some of the buttons unsupported by the Phonegap core plugins.

SEE [NOTES.onTesting.md](https://github.com/jessemonroy650/Phonegap-Events-test/blob/master/NOTES.onTesting.md) for those testing.
